## will you go out with me?

# run yourself 
requires a fairly new v of **node** and **git**!

fork and **pull**.
```sh
-> git add origin 
-> git pull origin
```

install **deps/dev deps** from [**`package.json`**](./package.json)

## `dev`
```sh
-> next dev
```
view at port **3k**.

## `build`
```sh
-> next build
```

## Mimi, I love you more than Git loves commits. Please accept my proposal, or I might just end up in an infinite loop of sadness! ðŸ’–
